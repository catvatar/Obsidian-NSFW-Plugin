# Obsidian NSFW Plugin
Obsidian plugin adding a sidebar button that toggles the visibility of NSFW marked files.
## Working principle
Any note that is inside `.folder/` is hidden from view inside obsidian. Pressing the **Toggle Visibility Button** moves marked files from their current location to selected `.folder/`. Plugin automatically creates cash file to save each files old location.
> `.folder` defaults to `.NSFW/`
## Motivation
This project was motivated by the need to hide personal notes from view when showing notes in public.
